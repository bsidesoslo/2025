When we talk about cybersecurity, it is easy to focus on all the problems and issues that surround us—breaches, vulnerabilities, and constant threats. 

But this talk is not about that. Instead I want to highlight the "wins"—the remarkable progress we've made in making the digital world more secure, and what we can learn from them! From tools you should learn about, to protocols, policy shifts you have to know about and much more!
