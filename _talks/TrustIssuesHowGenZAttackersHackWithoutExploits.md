Forget zero-days - today’s attackers are skipping the code and going straight for your trust. In this talk, we’ll explore how a new wave of cybercriminals, many young, non-technical, and highly creative, are bypassing traditional defenses using native tools, built-in features, and social engineering. 

From abusing RMM software and Microsoft Teams messages to weaponizing OneNote, these attackers don’t need exploits; they need credibility. We’ll break down real-world tactics, show how these attacks unfold, and discuss why defenders must shift their mindset from patching vulnerabilities to patching human trust.
