Today mainframes are commonly thought of as outdated and legacy technology - with most not realising that although your AD might be the keys to the kingdom within the company, your mainframe is still the crown jewels. They also still underpin a lot more of society than we think, and are an integral part of day-to-day life from card transactions through to airlines and supermarkets.

This talk will demystify some perceptions and assumptions about mainframes in general, show that they're far from legacy technology, and explore the different ways we can gain access and elevate our privileges on a z/OS system. Along the way you'll learn key z/OS concepts, and how you can get started with mainframe security research.
