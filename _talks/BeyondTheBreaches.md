Thanks to the GDPR, organizations have to inform data protection authorities about security incidents. In Norway, Datatilsynet is collecting these reports, and they are also available to the public as an important component of the government transparency effort. This presentation attempts to analyse these reports and technical follow-up after these breaches.
