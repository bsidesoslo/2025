Despite Linux's pervasive use, the landscape of Linux malware remains significantly under-researched, often leading to an overestimation of its sophistication. This talk challenges that perception by highlighting the surprising ease with which many Linux malware samples can be detected and analyzed. A core premise is that malware authors, perhaps due to this perceived obscurity, frequently forgo robust obfuscation techniques, leaving their malicious intent remarkably transparent.

Building upon this accessibility, the second part of the presentation will delve into an innovative approach for large-scale malware analysis. We will demonstrate how Large Language Models (LLMs), when integrated with a disassembler, can revolutionize the reverse engineering workflow. The inherent "straightforwardness" of many Linux malware samples makes them ideal candidates for LLM-assisted analysis, allowing for rapid and automated reporting on sample functionality within minutes. Attendees will gain practical insights, tips, and tricks for effectively leveraging LLMs in conjunction with traditional disassemblers to automate the tedious aspects of binary analysis, freeing up researchers to focus on deeper threat intelligence and novel attack vectors. This talk aims to demystify Linux malware analysis and empower security professionals with cutting-edge tools for efficient threat
