China carries out a significant amount of offensive cyber operations. Every year we hear warnings from the Norwegian intelligence and security services about espionage from China and Chinese cyberactors. NATO and the US describe the country as the greatest strategic threat in the decades ahead.

But how has China actually established structures and rigged their own society to become a major power in the cyber domain? And how does the regime in Beijing use all of society's resources to support the authorities' offensive cyber operations?

In this lecture, you will get a deep dive into how the ecosystem of civilian hackers, private IT companies, universities and intelligence services cooperate and play along with each other to support the Chinese authorities' offensive cyber operations.
