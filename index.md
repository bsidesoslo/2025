BSides Oslo is an independent, community-driven inclusive information and cyber security conference. As a part of the global Security BSides network, the conference creates a space for members of the international and local information security communities to come together and share their knowledge and experiences. BSides Oslo is intended for anyone who works with, studies or has an interest in infosec.

The first Security BSides Oslo event was held in 2019. The 2025 conference will be our sixth (fifth in-person) event. Websites for previous events are available [here](https://archive.bsidesoslo.no/).

As an event for the community, all talks at our conferences are recorded and available on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/bsidesoslo).

BSides Oslo is a non-profit conference, and there are still some sponsor opportunities. For more information, please review the [sponsorship primer](/pages/SponsorPrimer).
